It contains over 330,000 cross - subreddit links, involving over 67,000 subreddits
Each link represents a post in one subreddit linking to a post in another subreddit
Each link in the data comes with an emotion label (positive/neutral or negative)

Focus on cross-community links with negative labels 
Negative links are commonly found in hostile behaviors such as mockery, criticism, and attacks 
Regard these links as direct signals of community conflicts
