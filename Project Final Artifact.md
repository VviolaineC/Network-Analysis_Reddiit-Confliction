# Mapping Online Conflict: A Study of Inter-Subreddit Dynamics on Reddit

## Introduction
Reddit functions as a network of thousands of subcommunities (subreddits). While most content remains siloed within a single subreddit, some posts contain hyperlinks that cross into other subreddits. These cross-subreddit interactions can sometimes foster support between communities, but in other cases they trigger conflict. This study aims to understand how cross-subreddit interactions reflect community dynamics, with a particular focus on conflict propagation. Our work builds on the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP) Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset and draws on insights from a prior study by Kumar et al. (2018) on inter-community conflict. In contrast to prior work, we leverage sentiment labels on cross-subreddit links to map the structure of conflict spread on Reddit and identify potential intervention points.

## Data and Methods
We utilize the Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset (2005–2017), which comprises over 330,000 directed hyperlinks between more than 67,000 subreddits. Each hyperlink represents a post in one subreddit that links to a post in another subreddit. Each link is annotated with a timestamp, an 86-dimensional text feature vector, and a polarity label indicating whether the source post expresses a negative (hostile) or neutral/positive sentiment toward the target. This dataset was previously used by Cheng et al. (2017) to study community mobilization and collective behavior. In this analysis, we focus on the subset of links carrying negative sentiment, as these indicate instances of inter-community conflict.

To prepare the data for analysis, several preprocessing steps were performed:

•	Data Cleaning: Parsed and cleaned all timestamps, and standardized subreddit names to ensure consistency.

•	Feature Processing: Split the post feature vector into individual components and normalized all sentiment-related metrics (including those based on LIWC).

•	Link Aggregation: Aggregated the data by subreddit pairs, counting the total number of links from each source subreddit to each target subreddit, as well as the number of negative vs. positive links for each pair.

•	Network Construction: Constructed a directed, weighted network of subreddits, where nodes represent subreddits and a directed edge from subreddit A to subreddit B indicates that A has posts linking to B. Each edge’s weight is the number of hyperlinks from A to B, and we calculate the proportion of those links that are negative in sentiment (the negative link ratio) as an edge attribute.

•	Conflict Subnetwork Extraction: Extracted a “conflict subnetwork” consisting of only the edges with high negative link ratios. This subnetwork highlights the strongest channels of hostile interactions between communities, allowing us to examine how conflict propagates through the network.

## Results

### Network Overview: 
The overall Reddit subreddit network is extremely sparse. It contains 67,180 subreddit nodes connected by 339,643 directed edges (hyperlinks). On average, each subreddit links to only about five others. However, a few subreddits serve as major hubs. For example, the subreddit with the highest in-degree is r/AskReddit, which receives 5,448 incoming links from other communities. The subreddit with the highest out-degree has over 3,000 outgoing links to different communities. This suggests that a small number of communities serve as information hubs within the network. The degree distribution exhibits a clear pattern common to many online networks: most subreddits have very few cross-subreddit connections, while a few have extremely high connectivity.

### Conflict Dynamics: 
Within this network, the distribution of conflict is highly uneven. We identified three distinct roles that subreddits play in conflict propagation. First, there are conflict source communities, which actively initiate a large number of negative cross-subreddit links. For example, niche subreddits like r/ShitGnomeSays and r/imablue exhibit over 90% negative sentiment in their outbound links, signaling a strongly aggressive stance toward other communities. Second, there are conflict target communities, such as r/sjwnews, which frequently receive hostile inbound links but do not significantly retaliate or link out negatively themselves. Third, we found bridge communities that act as intermediaries connecting disparate groups. A notable case is r/SubredditDrama, which stood out as a central hub in this network, connecting communities that otherwise rarely interacted. r/SubredditDrama plays a pivotal role in disseminating conflict-related content across community boundaries by drawing attention to “drama” in various subreddits.

From these observations, we draw several key insights about conflict propagation on Reddit. First, the propagation structure is highly heterogeneous, relying on a small fraction of bridge communities to connect conflict across the platform. Second, although many aggressive or controversial subreddits are relatively small, their ability to initiate conflicts is disproportionate and can trigger cascading effects throughout the network. Third, mainstream subreddits that are not primarily focused on conflict (including some default homepage communities like r/AskReddit) can become unwitting conduits for the spread of conflict due to their large audience and visibility.

### Intervention Strategies
Based on the above findings, we propose a set of targeted intervention strategies aimed at mitigating cross-subreddit conflict while preserving healthy community interactions:

1. Monitor and Throttle Key “Bridge” Communities: Platforms should closely monitor the small number of subreddits that serve as connectors in the conflict network. For instance, a community like r/SubredditDrama (identified as a major bridge) could be subject to special oversight. If a subreddit is acting as a major conduit for conflict, the platform could put it under special monitoring or even temporarily throttle its ability to post links to many communities. In other words, if one subreddit suddenly starts a flood of hostile cross-posts, Reddit can slow it down and alert moderators to intervene. Simulating the removal or down-ranking of these hub communities within the network (via network analysis experiments) can also help assess their true impact and guide whether such interventions would significantly reduce conflict spread.
2. Rein in Aggressor Communities: Small, aggressive subreddits that repeatedly start conflicts should be addressed with automated and manual interventions. Those “instigator” subreddits that are frequently attacking others may need proactive moderation. An automated system could flag subreddits that send an unusually high proportion of negative links. In other words, if a community’s outbound posts are mostly attacks, it would be flagged for moderators or admins to review. The platform might then reduce that community’s visibility (so its toxic posts spread less) and prompt its moderators or members to tone down the antagonism.
3. Safeguard Mainstream Communities: Large default or general-interest subreddits (like r/AskReddit) are not direct sources of conflict, but due to their size, they can amplify controversial content. To prevent unsuspecting users in these communities from being drawn into conflicts, changes in recommendation algorithms and cross-posting policies could help. This could mean tweaking recommendation algorithms so that posts from very controversial subreddits don’t get pushed to the top of big default subs. In addition, large communities could adopt guidelines to “keep outside drama out” — for example, moderators might remove posts that solely aim to stir up inter-community conflict. By creating a buffer around mainstream communities, the platform can stop a lot of conflict-heavy content from rapidly reaching a broad audience.

Collectively, these three strategies—focused on network hubs, aggressive actors, and content-spread mechanisms—form a multi-layered approach to conflict mitigation. By implementing such measures, platforms like Reddit could maintain an open and diverse ecosystem while curbing the unchecked spread of hostility. The goal is to strike a balance where communities retain their autonomy and freedom of expression, but clear safeguards exist to prevent disproportionate harm from negative cross-subreddit interactions.

## Limitations
This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. First, the dataset we used provides only numeric and label representations of posts (e.g. sentiment scores and feature vectors), without the full textual content of the posts. Because of this, our analysis cannot directly leverage advanced natural language processing techniques or large language models to interpret the nuanced context or language of the cross-subreddit interactions. The lack of textual data means we might miss subtleties such as sarcasm, satire, or coded language that could influence whether a link is truly hostile.

Second, although each cross-subreddit link in the dataset comes with a sentiment label (negative vs. neutral/positive), these labels are generated by an automatic classifier trained on crowdsourced annotations. Such labels, while more reliable than a basic sentiment analysis, are imperfect. They may misclassify certain types of content—for example, a link posted with an ironic tone or as part of an in-joke might be labeled negative when the intent was not genuinely hostile. This limitation means our identification of “negative” interactions may sometimes include false positives or overlook context that a human reader would catch.

Third, our network analysis is mostly static and aggregates all data from 2005 to 2017. We did not deeply examine how conflict interactions evolve over time. Although timestamps are available in the dataset, the uneven distribution of posts over the years and the lack of continuous activity data made it challenging to construct a reliable time-series or dynamic network model. As a result, our conclusions speak more to the overall structure of conflict in this period rather than specific temporal trends or the evolution of particular disputes.
Future Directions

There are several promising directions for extending this research. One immediate step is to incorporate the actual content of cross-subreddit posts into the analysis. If we can obtain or reconstruct the original post texts, we could apply modern language models to analyze tone, rhetoric, and context. This content-driven approach would complement the structural network analysis by helping explain why certain links are negative—illuminating the narratives or issues driving conflicts, not just mapping where they occur.

Another important direction is to add a temporal dimension to the network analysis. By breaking the data into snapshots (for instance, by month or year), we could observe how the web of cross-subreddit interactions and conflicts changes over time. This would allow us to see if certain subreddits become more or less conflict-prone, or if new bridge communities emerge while others fade. Temporal modeling could also help in predicting surges of conflict and identifying early warning signs in the network when tensions are escalating.

Finally, it would be valuable to compare the conflict dynamics observed on Reddit with those on other social platforms that have distinct community structures, such as Twitter (with hashtags or follower networks), Facebook groups, or Discord servers. By applying a similar network lens to these platforms, we can assess whether the patterns we observed on Reddit—a few communities instigating most conflicts and the presence of “bridge” entities amplifying disputes—are unique to Reddit or part of a broader online phenomenon. Such comparative analysis would make the findings more generalizable and provide insight into platform-specific features that influence how online conflicts spread.

## Conclusion
In summary, this project mapped the landscape of inter-subreddit conflict on Reddit and uncovered a highly skewed structure of interaction. A small minority of subreddits disproportionately drive cross-subreddit conflicts, either by initiating negative links or by acting as hubs that spread these conflicts widely. At the same time, large popular communities—often uninvolved in originating conflicts—can inadvertently amplify contentious content due to their broad reach. Our findings underscore the importance of considering network structure in content moderation: interventions targeted at key nodes (aggressive source communities and critical bridge communities) and adjusted content recommendation practices can significantly curb the spread of online conflict. While our analysis is constrained by the available data and a static approach, it lays a foundation for more nuanced studies of online community interactions. There is certainly room to build on this work—like analyzing post content for context or studying how conflicts evolve over time—but mapping these dynamics is already a step toward making online spaces safer and more welcoming for everyone.
